For this project, I used data Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:

Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulfates
Alcohol

## Objectives
### The objectives of this project are as follows:
To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy
To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine

##Steps included in this project:

Importing Lib
Loading Data
Understanding Data
Missing Values
Exploring Variables(Data Anylasis)
Preprocessig Data
Split the data
Feature Selection
Preparing Data for Modelling
Applying different models

# Conclusion
By following these steps, we have successfully built and evaluated classification models to determine which physicochemical properties make a wine 'good'. We also explored feature selection to potentially improve model performance. You can further fine-tune the models and explore other feature selection methods to get better results.
